# 🖼️ Image Captioning using Deep Learning

This project implements an **automatic Image Captioning system** that generates meaningful textual descriptions for images using Deep Learning techniques.

The model is trained on the **Flickr30k dataset**, which contains thousands of images paired with multiple human-written captions, making it ideal for learning visual–language relationships.

The architecture combines:

- **CNN** for image feature extraction  
- **LSTM** for sequence modeling and caption generation
